Fractal Tutorial
================

This tutorial includes several implementations of a Mandelbrot set Fractal code.
The code originated from Dr. Martin Burtscher of the Efficient Computing Lab at
Texas State University. You can find more here: https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/research.html

In the "extras" directories, there are a few other RAJA implementations such
as OpenMP and even a native CUDA implementation just for comparison. You can reference
these implementation to study the differences in implementation and runtime comparison.
However, anything beyond that is outside the scope of this tutorial.

In the following lessons, you will compare RAJA implementations of the fractal generating code. 
We will start with a sequential implementation of the fractal and gradually build our
way up to a more complex RAJA launch implementation.
You will notice that these lessons will employ the RAJA kernel and launch abstractions.
Additionally, as the lessons progress, we will be exploring the performance portability
of RAJA by looking at how we can change the targeted backend from CUDA to HIP.
(Refer to lessons 02-CUDA and 03-HIP).

As before, the exercises have COMPILE macro guards. To compile the code, uncomment the 
COMPILE define at the top of the file. 

If you are doing this tutorial outside of the RADIUSS tutorial series, be sure to build
the tutorial within a newly created, empty `build` directory located
in the `raja-suite-tutorial` repo. If you're on a LC machine, you can run these commands:
```
module load cuda/11.2.0
module load cmake/3.20.2
module load gcc/8.3.1
cmake -DENABLE_CUDA=On -DENABLE_OPENMP=Off -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=70 -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-11.2.0/bin/nvcc -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-11.2.0 -DBLT_CXX_STD=c++14 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRAJA_ENABLE_EXERCISES=On -DRAJA_ENABLE_OPENMP=Off -DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS=--extended-lambda -DCUDA_ARCH=sm_70 ../
```

I am building this code on LC's lassen machine. If these build instructions don't work for you, you can refer to the build documentation from RAJA's ReadTheDocs or use one of the provided build scripts.

Now, we can build the RAJA loop-exec implementation with `./bin/fractal 1024`. The 
first argument is the width of the fractal (1024). It may be interesting to see how 
the fractal changes with different width values.

To verify your results in each lesson, you can look at the resulting .bmp file output. If you
have completed everything correctly, you will see a complete image of the fractal.
Currently, there is an `if` statement that makes sure the `writeBMP` function
is only called for smaller fractal runs (of width <= 2048). You can edit this `if` statement, but be careful because trying
to write a .bmp file that is too large will take a very long time.

Continue on to the first lesson located in the `00-BASE` directory.
