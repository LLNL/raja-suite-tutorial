# RAJA Portability Suite Tutorial Series

Welcome to the RAJA Portability Suite tutorial series. In this repo, you
will find a set of tutorials. This set includes an introductory tutorial
which will provide guided set of lessons to follow to learn how to get
started with the RAJA Portability Suite. The set also includes a more
advanced (i.e. Intermediate) tutorial meant for those who would like more 
hands-on instruction for RAJA. We would suggest starting with the Intro 
tutorial and then moving on to the Intermediate tutorial.

Be sure to do the following before continuing to the tutorials:
`module load cmake/3.20.2`
`module load gcc/8.3.1`

(Note: you need a cmake version greater than 3.19 and you need a more
recent gcc version which can handle c++14.)
