# RAJA Portability Suite Intro Tutorial

Welcome to the RAJA Portability Suite Intro tutorial. In this tutorial, you
will learn how to use RAJA and Umpire to write simple platform portable code
that can be compiled to target different hardware architectures.

## Lessons

Lessons are in the `lessons` subdirectory. Each lesson has a README file
that introduces new concepts and provides instructions to complete the lesson.
Each lesson builds on the previous ones to allow you to practice using RAJA
and Umpire capabilities and to reinforce the content.

Lessons contain source files with missing code and instructions for you to fill
in the missing parts along with solution files that contain the completed 
lesson code. If you get stuck, you can diff the lesson and solution files to see
the code that the lesson is asking you to fill in.
