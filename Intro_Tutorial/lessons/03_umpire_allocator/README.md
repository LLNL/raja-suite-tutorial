# Lesson 3

In this lesson, you will learn how to use Umpire to allocate memory. The file
`03_umpire_allocator.cpp` contains some `TODO:` comments where you can add code to allocate and
deallocate memory.

The fundamental concept for accessing memory through Umpire is the
`umpire::Allocator`. An `umpire::Allocator` is a C++ object that can be used to
allocate and deallocate memory, as well as query a pointer to get
information about it. (Note: in this lesson, we will see how to query the name of the Allocator!)

All `umpire::Allocator` objects are created and managed by Umpireâ€™s
`umpire::ResourceManager`. To create an allocator, first obtain a handle to the
ResourceManager, and then request the Allocator corresponding to the desired
memory resource using the `getAllocator` function:

```
auto& rm = umpire::ResourceManager::getInstance();
auto allocator = rm.getAllocator("HOST");
```

The Allocator class provides methods for allocating and deallocating memory. You
can view these methods in the Umpire source code documentation here:
https://umpire.readthedocs.io/en/develop/doxygen/html/classumpire_1_1Allocator.html

To use an Umpire allocator, use the following code, replacing "size in bytes" with
the desired size for your allocation:

```
void* memory = allocator.allocate(size in bytes);
```

Moving and modifying data in a heterogenous memory system can be annoying since you 
have to keep track of the source and destination, and often use vendor-specific APIs 
to perform the modifications. In Umpire, all data modification and movement, regardless
of memory resource or platform, is done using Operations. 

Next, we will use the `memset` Operator provided by Umpire's Resource Manager to
set the memory we just allocated to zero.

Don't forget to deallocate your memory afterwards!

For more details, you can check out the Umpire documentation:
https://umpire.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/tutorial/allocators.html

Once you have made your changes, you can compile and run the lesson:

```
$ make 03_umpire_allocator
$ ./bin/03_umpire_allocator
Allocated 800 bytes and set to 0 using the HOST allocator.
```
